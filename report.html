    <h3>Story of the Website</h3>
    <p>I have built a website on Taiwanese Food, including articles and different information
        on them.
    </p>
    <h3>Structure of the Website</h3>
    <p>For this Website, I have chosen to build it in a way such that "Images Dominates Text"
        . Visual contents take up most portion of my websites as they are more likely to catch
        other's attention and stand out than pure texts. In addition to that, the website has
        5 pages in total, and there are links to each one of them at the top and bottom of each
        page.
    </p>

    <h1>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>My Geometric Location</li>
        <li>My Own Personal Experience</li>
        <li>The Acceptability of Topic</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As a Taiwanese boy, I was gifted with the opportunity to explore a great variety of food when I was born
        as Taiwan encompasses many different cuisines from  large fish such as tuna to beef. As a result, I would
        like to take this change and expose what my country has in store to more people. On top of that, I was born and raised
        by chiefs. My parents have been working as professional chiefs years before I was born, and without a doubt
        that have a drastic impact on me since I was given much more changes to understand our cuisines than average
        people living here. Therefore, building a website on Taiwanese food is extremely suitable for me as I have a 
        deep understanding of this topic already. Moreover, another important inspiration to me is the fact that topics
        on food are generally likely to give rise to interest from others as food is part of our daily life that cannot
        be separated, and a website on food is not limited to a specific group of audience. For this reason, I believe
        that my chosen topic is the most appropriate one for the topic of a website
    </p>

    <h1>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I have chosen appropriate HTML tags for different sections of my website instead of simply applying div tags to
            everything. 
        </li>
        <li>My website follows the convention that every section always starts with a heading tag, followed by
            more texts and images for details. This ensures that different parts of the website share similar layouts
            and are subject to great accessibility and maintainability.
        </li>
        <li>
            To minimize the chances of images not displaying property, I have chosen to store all of them in a local folder
            instead of having them uploaded to the Internet. Furthermore, I have also added descriptive alternative texts for
            each images in case of some unexpected accidents 
        </li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section>

    <h1>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I have created visible indication of focus on my website. For instance a great number of CSS 
            hover effect has been applied to most important part of the website to provide a clue of what they are 
            looking at to the user
        </li>
        <li>Sufficient white spaces can be seen across my website as they makes texts easier to read and server well
            to separate each section of the website
        </li>
        <li>
            On the recipe page, I have created a responsive design that automatically hides some part of the text 
            on mobile device because mobile screens are limited by their size and too many texts at the same time
            can easily decrease the usability of the website
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            During the process of building my website, I realized that there are always gaps between my knowledge and that
            being able to figure out the problems I have never encountered before with the help of the Internet is a crucial skill.
            For example, when I was building a image carousel using my own approach I found out that having multiple carousels
            in the same page were going to cause some issues to the display of the images. Fortunately, I found a post on StackOverFlow
            that described same problems, and with a few attempts I was able to adapt that solution to my websites and created
            multiple fully functional carousels in the same page.
        </li>
        <li>Having to make a website myself, I finally understand the importance of responsive design. Without having applied
            responsive layouts to my website, a small text section could have taken up an entire mobile screen and had a fairly
            negative effect on the displays of other elements. Having made my website responsive, I have ensured the accessibility
            on different platforms including PC and mobile devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Constantly making changes to my website, I have truly started to appreciate Version Control System. Due to the fact that
            a small change to CSS could result in a drastic change to my website layout, I used GIT to save different of
            my source code in case unexpected behaviors caused by changes to CSS, and that succeeded in preventing me from 
            ruining a huge section of my website as I could easily revert the changes made to previous stable states with the help
            of GIT
        </li>
    </ol>
</section>
<hr>
<section>
    <h1>What aspects of your work do you think worked well and why?</h1>
    <p>Without a doubt, I am most proud of the recipe page of my website. For that page, I made a tab section that
        displays different recipes depending on the tab that is currently active. Inside each tab section is an image carousel
        that displays different images responsive to user's action. I truly learned how to properly build abstractions 
        in JavaScript so that I could focus on coding each functionality based on previous-built abstractions without 
        needing to concern myself with other parts that are not in the current abstraction layer. Had I chosen to build
        the tab section and image carousels at the same time, I would have faced a great deal of issues for not using abstractions to make
        those tasks bearable.
    </p>
</section>
<hr>
<section>
    <h1>What aspects of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h1>
    <p>I wish I could have added more pages to the article page. In that page, I created a next/previous HTML page navigation
        with JavaScript, but due to some unknown issues I was not able to add more than two pages without causing the pages 
        to malfunction, and I suppose that it has something to do with a function that I wrote because it could only
        hide one page when I clicked on the page-switching button, and all the previous pages would still display normally.
        In order to fix it, I would give each page an unique ID and store them in array next time. Without feeling the necessity,
        I did not use any data structure to store each page and just give them an ID, but it turned out that having them
        stored in some form of data structure would make them more maintainable and cause less issues. Next time, I would
        use a for loop to loop over the array that stores the IDs of the each page and set the current one to active and
        the other to hidden.
